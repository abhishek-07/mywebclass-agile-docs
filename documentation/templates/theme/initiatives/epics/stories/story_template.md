"As a [developer], I want to construct a website that is functional, responsive, secure, and performance-optimized, so that it delivers a smooth and satisfying user experience, satisfies project goals, and adheres to industry standards and best practices."

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Branding must be across the portal throughout the website.
2. The website must work and provide all project parameters.
3. The website must be responsive on computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
4. The website must safeguard user data from illegal access, misuse, and hacking.
